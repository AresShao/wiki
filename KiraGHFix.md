### Note: Implementing this fix will not void your warranty.

### Tools Required:
 - Small flat metal file
 - Small phillips screwdriver
 - Included switch puller & keycap puller

### Steps:

Time required: about 5 minutes.

1. Remove the upper plate from the Kira. 
    - Lift the ring off the Kira, lift from the back edge first and then the front edge. Metal rings are held on with magnets, while plastic rings are held on by snapping in. Both types should lift off fairly easily.
    - Remove your switches/ keycaps with the included switch puller / keycap puller. (You do not need to remove stabilizers.)
    - Once all switches are removed, undo the screws from the plate. Be careful when removing the plate as it may still be lightly connected to the PCB. Make sure the PCB does not become disconnected from the USB-C controller (connected by wires) at the back of the case.
    - The plastic notches around the plate must be lightly released to allow the plate to lift off.
2. With the plate separated, grab a thin flat-edge file. At a slight angle towards the screw’s top edge, lightly file the inside edge. Do not file the corner directly. It will not take very much filing to produce a straight switch, from my testing only about 30 seconds. Be sure to test periodically with a spare switch / keycap to check if it’s straight.
3. Once your switches look straight, you will need to replace the plate. Make sure the PCB lines up with the top plate and press it down into place. Then simply rescrew, socket the switches / keycaps, replace the ring, and you’ll be good to go.
