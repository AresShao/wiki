### Steps:

1. Remove the upper plate from the Kira. 
 	- Lift the ring off the Kira, lift from the back edge first and then the front edge. Metal rings are held on with magnets, while plastic rings are held on by snapping in. Both types should lift off fairly easily.

    - Remove your switches/ keycaps with the included switch puller / keycap puller. (You do not need to remove stabilizers.)

    	- Switches are removed by pinching the small top and bottom notches with the switch puller and pulling straight up. If a switch is giving you trouble, simply give it a little wiggle and it should free itself. Switches are fairly durable, but be sure not to crush any under your unimaginable strength.
    	- The two veritcally stabilized switches on the right end by the numberpad (Enter and +) are moutned horizontally, they will need to be removed by pinching from the left and right.

    - Once all switches are removed, undo the 6 surrounding screws from the plate. Be careful when removing the plate as it is still connected to the PCB.

		- Make sure the PCB does not become disconnected from the USB-C controller (connected by wires) at the back of the case.
		- The plastic notches around the plate must be lightly released to allow the plate to lift off.
    - Gently flip the PCB and plate over. Remove the three mounting screws securing them together. Set the PCB and plastic bottom housing aside.

2. With the plate separated, grab a thin flat-edge file.

    At a slight angle towards the screw’s top edge, lightly file the inside edge. Do not file the corner directly. It will not take very much filing to produce a straight switch, from my testing only about 30 seconds.

    Be sure to test periodically with a spare switch / keycap to check if it’s straight.

3. Once your switches look straight, you will need to replace the plate.
	- Make sure the PCB lines up with the top plate and gently press them together.
	- Rescrew the 3 round mounting screws between the bottom of the PCB and plate.
	- Place the PCB and plate properly into the bottom housing, using the screw stands as guides.
	- Screw the 6 mounting screws to hold the plate down.
	- When resocketing your switches, make sure that the connecting pins line up and do not become bent. Line the pins over the sockets and push straight down firmly. They will snap into place.
	- Keep in mind the two horizontal switches for numpad Enter and +.
	- Once all swithces have been replaced, replace your keycaps and top ring, and you’ll be good to go.
