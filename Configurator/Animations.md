?> Follow the [Quickstart guide](Quickstart.md) to load the new configuration to your keyboard.

## Multiple Animations

Some animations can be applied ontop of other animations.
For instance, changing the changing the color of pressed keys.

You can repeat the above process to add more animations. Just make sure to only have one enabled at start.

See [Animation Control](Configurator/Keys.md#animation-controls) for how to start or stop an animation with a key.
